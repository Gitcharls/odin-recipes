        <ol>
            <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken pieces until golden brown
                on
                both sides, then remove. Stir in the onion and garlic; cook until they soften and brown, about 6
                minutes.

            </li>
            <li>Pour in vinegar and soy sauce, and season with garlic powder, black pepper, and bay leaf. Add the
                browned
                chicken, increase the heat to high, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer
                until
                the chicken is tender and cooked through, 35 to 40 minutes.</li>
