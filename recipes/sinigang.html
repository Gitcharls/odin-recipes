<h2>Pork Sinigang</h2>
<p>
    Filipino soup cooked with pork. Serve with rice and for additional sauce, use soy or fish sauce. If you want to, you
    can add what Filipinos call gabi gabi, which is a small taro root. When peeled they look like potatoes. You can add
    5 to 6 of them when you add the water and make sure they are cooked through. Take them out when they are cooked
    because they can get too soft.

<h3>Indgredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 (1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger, chopped</li>
    <li>2 plum tomatoes, cut into 1/2-inch dice</li>
    <li>1 pound bone-in pork chops</li>
    <li>4 cups water, more if needed</li>
    <li>1 (1.41 ounce) package tamarind soup base (such as Knorr®)</li>
    <li>½ pound fresh green beans, trimmed</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Begin by washing pork spare ribs in cold running water to remove any visible impurities. Then, place pork ribs
        submerge in a medium pot with a liter of water. Bring to a boil without covering the pot and allow the scum to
        float to the surface. Meticulously remove the scums from the surface of the water using a slotted spoon or a
        spatula. Scums are impurities found in meat.
    </li>
    <li>After the broth clears up, turn you heat to medium setting, then it’s time toss in your onions and tomatoes to
        add flavor to the broth. Cover your pot and let it simmer to fully cook your meat. Use a fork to pierce the meat
        so that the flavors would also enter the meaty parts of the spare ribs, You also do this so you can tell if it’s
        already set and tender.
    </li>
    <li>You can already add your vegetables. Start by adding the sitaw, kangkong stalks and talong into the pot and cook
        until these turn dark green. If you decide to use labanos and okra, you can also add those at this point. This
        should take roughly around 2-3 minutes.</li>
    <li>
        Add in your siling sigang, kangkong leaves and the Knorr Sinigang sa Sampaloc Mix. Stir and let it simmer. It
        should be done in about 2-3 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>All done! Transfer your Sinigang to a serving bowl. This is a happy treat that warms, soothes and satisfies
        everyone in the family! Remember to prepare extra servings of rice to enjoy the extra asim kilig taste of this
        Filipino classic soup. Enjoy!</li>
